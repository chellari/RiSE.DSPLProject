# RiSE_DSPLProject
DSPL engineering provides support at development of DAS by capturing and managing the dynamic variability. Although the DSPL product derivation occurs at runtime, the software engineer must determine at design time the information that can affect the variability configuration such as Non-functional requirements (NFRs) and contexts. These information consist of conflicting and competing objectives and make the product configuration process in a complex optimization problem. Based on it, software engineer need to be assisted with a suitable strategy to choose a set of desirable features that attends these objectives when an adaptation is required. However, few studies propose an approach to solve this issue or do not use any strategy for dealing with configuration selection conflicts by considering NFRs and contexts. In this way, we proposed an approach based on utility function to deal with trade-off analysis in the DSPL life-cycle. In addition, we defined an optimization model that recommends an optimal configuration according to the stakeholders preferences, variability of system features, contexts, and NFRs.
